# Expense Approval Fix Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Triple Notifications
**Root Cause:** Multiple notification subscriptions were firing for the same event:
- NotificationCenter had a subscription with browser notifications
- NotificationContainer had a global subscription with browser notifications
- Both were listening to the same database INSERT events

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed browser notifications from NotificationContainer (only toast notifications remain)
- Optimized notifySubscribers to prevent duplicate calls to the same listener
- NotificationCenter now handles all browser notifications

### 2. Status Not Updating
**Root Cause:** The optimistic update was being applied but not using the actual server response

**Fix Applied:**
- Now using the actual updated expense object returned from the server
- Properly clearing approval notes after successful approval
- Added success toast notification for confirmation
- Added error recovery with data reload on failure

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Single Notification
1. Open the expense management page
2. Find a pending expense
3. Click the "Approve" button
4. Add optional notes and confirm
5. **Expected:** You should see only ONE floating notification (not 3)

### Test 2: Status Update
1. After approving an expense
2. **Expected:** The status should immediately change from "pending" to "approved"
3. The approved date and approver info should be visible
4. The approve/reject buttons should disappear

### Test 3: Page Refresh
1. After approving an expense
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected:** The expense should still show as "approved"

### Test 4: Browser Notifications
1. Ensure browser notifications are enabled
2. Approve an expense
3. **Expected:** You should see ONE browser notification (if enabled)

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist:

1. **Check Console:** Open browser DevTools and look for any errors
2. **Check Network Tab:** Verify the API call to update approval succeeds
3. **Check Database:** Verify the expense status is actually updated in the database

## Additional Notes

- The notification service now prevents duplicate subscriptions
- The expense management component now properly handles server responses
- Success/error toasts provide immediate feedback
- Approval notes are properly cleared after each approval
