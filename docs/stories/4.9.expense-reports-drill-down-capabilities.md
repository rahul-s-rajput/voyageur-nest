# Story 4.9: Reports & Analytics - Drill-Down Capabilities

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As an analyst,
I want to click and contextually act on data points and cross-filter charts,
So that I can explore insights interactively without leaving the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chart Interactions
   - Click bar/line/segment to filter data
   - Breadcrumb navigation for drill levels
   - Undo/redo support
2. Contextual Actions
   - Right-click menus (or long-press on mobile)
   - View details, Export selection, Add annotation
3. Cross-Filtering
   - Selecting in one chart filters others
   - Clear filter indicators
   - Reset-all option

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement selection state and breadcrumb navigation
  - [ ] Global drill-down context manager
  - [ ] Animated breadcrumb transitions
  - [ ] Mobile-friendly breadcrumb scrolling
- [ ] Add contextual menus with actions and hooks
  - [ ] Custom hook for context menu positioning
  - [ ] Touch-friendly long-press detection
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Build cross-filter bus to propagate filters across charts
  - [ ] Event-driven filter synchronization
  - [ ] Debounced updates for performance
  - [ ] Visual indicators on affected charts
- [ ] Provide undo/redo stack and reset-all control
  - [ ] Maximum 10 history states
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
  - [ ] Visual timeline of actions
- [ ] Real-time drill-down updates
  - [ ] WebSocket subscription for filtered data
  - [ ] Optimistic UI updates

## Dev Notes
- Reference: `docs/implementation-plans/expense-reports-ui-improvement-plan.md` (Phase 2 - Task 2.2)
- Suggested: Zustand or React Context for shared filter state
- Add analytics for user interactions
- Architecture:
  - `DrillDownContext` for navigation state
  - `CrossFilterContext` for filter propagation
  - `UndoRedoProvider` for history management
- Suggested locations:
  - Contexts: `src/contexts/reports/DrillDownContext.tsx`, `src/contexts/reports/CrossFilterContext.tsx`, `src/contexts/reports/UndoRedoProvider.tsx`
  - Components: `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/interactions/Breadcrumbs.tsx`, `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/menus/ContextMenu.tsx`
  - Hook: `src/hooks/useContextMenu.ts`
- Foundation: Story 4.0 provides base architecture
- Location: New ReportsAnalytics section (not ExpenseManagement)
- No legacy code dependencies
- Performance:
  - Drill-down response: <200ms
  - Cross-filter update: <100ms
  - Support 50+ concurrent filters
- Guest House Context:
  - Common drill paths: Category → Vendor → Transaction
  - Property comparison drill-downs
  - Seasonal pattern exploration

## Testing
- [ ] Drill in/out works and breadcrumbs update
- [ ] Context menu actions function on desktop and mobile (long-press)
- [ ] Cross-filters apply in real-time and can be reset
- [ ] Performance remains smooth under cross-filtering
- [ ] Undo/redo maintains correct state
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work correctly
- [ ] Touch gestures don't conflict
- [ ] Memory usage with deep drill-downs
- [ ] Real-time updates during drill-down
- [ ] Export maintains drill-down context
- [ ] Dark mode context menus

## Success Metrics
- Drill-down usage: >60% of users explore data
- Cross-filter adoption: >40% use multiple filters
- Undo usage: Reduces errors by 30%
- Performance: <200ms drill-down response

## Integration Points
- Export: Include drill-down path in exports
- Scheduled reports: Save drill-down states
- Real-time: Updates respect current drill level
- Annotations: Add notes at any drill level

## Prerequisites
- Story 4.0 (Reports & Analytics Foundation) must be completed

## Dependencies
- 4.17: Real-time Updates & Auto-refresh — live filtered data streams for drill levels
- 4.18: Dark Mode & Print Support — theme consistency for context menus and breadcrumbs
- 4.19: PWA & Offline Support — offline drill history and queued interactions
- 4.20: Mobile UI Enhancements — long-press gestures and bottom sheets for contextual actions
- 4.21: Chart Export & Sharing — export selections maintaining drill path
- 4.25: React Query + TanStack Table — cached queries per drill context and invalidation
- 4.22/4.23: Weather & Local Events — optional overlays to explain context at deeper drill levels
- 4.24: Mobile Push Notifications — optional alerts for saved drill states (e.g., anomalies)
