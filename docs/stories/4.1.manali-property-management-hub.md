## Dev Notes

### Multi-Property Architecture Context
This story transforms the existing single-property React + TypeScript + Supabase architecture into a comprehensive multi-property management system. The implementation establishes the foundation for managing multiple properties (Old Manali - backpacker-friendly, Baror - family-oriented) with seamless property switching, cross-property analytics, and property-specific configurations.

### Database Schema Extensions (Multi-Property)
The implementation requires significant database schema enhancements:

#### Core Multi-Property Tables:
```sql
-- Properties table (as defined in system_architecture.md)
CREATE TABLE properties (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  website_url VARCHAR(255),
  check_in_time TIME DEFAULT '14:00',
  check_out_time TIME DEFAULT '11:00',
  total_rooms INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  amenities JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  policies JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  branding JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Room inventory table for specific room management
CREATE TABLE rooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  property_id UUID REFERENCES properties(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  room_number VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'standard', 'deluxe', 'twin_single'
  floor INTEGER,
  max_occupancy INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
  base_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  amenities JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(property_id, room_number)
);

-- Initial room data for Old Manali and Baror
INSERT INTO properties (name, total_rooms, settings) VALUES 
('Old Manali', 8, '{"target_market": "backpacker", "room_types": ["standard", "twin_single", "deluxe"]}'),
('Baror', 4, '{"target_market": "family", "room_types": ["deluxe"]}');

-- Old Manali rooms
INSERT INTO rooms (property_id, room_number, room_type, max_occupancy) VALUES 
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '102', 'standard', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '103', 'standard', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '104', 'standard', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '105', 'standard', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '106', 'twin_single', 1), -- Can be booked separately
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '108', 'deluxe', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '109', 'deluxe', 2),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Old Manali'), '110', 'deluxe', 2);

-- Baror rooms (all deluxe)
INSERT INTO rooms (property_id, room_number, room_type, max_occupancy) VALUES 
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Baror'), '101', 'deluxe', 4),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Baror'), '102', 'deluxe', 4),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Baror'), '201', 'deluxe', 4),
((SELECT id FROM properties WHERE name = 'Baror'), '202', 'deluxe', 4);
```
