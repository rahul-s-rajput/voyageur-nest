# Story: Telegram Bot - Documentation & Usage Examples
Provide concise documentation for staff on how to use the bot for daily tasks, with screenshots/GIFs optional later.

## Prerequisites
- Stories 6.1–6.7 planned.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docs page includes: how to start, property switching, booking creation, expense capture, quick reports.
- Includes example command sequences.
- Notes on who is authorized and how to request access.
 - Explicit note that date-based commands and prompts use IST (Asia/Kolkata) by default; can be overridden by `BOT_TIMEZONE` if configured by admin.

## Tasks
- Create usage guide in this story file under Dev Notes.
- Optionally add a link from `README.md` to this story.

## Dev Notes
- Example flows:
  - Booking:
    ```
    /book
    Guest? Rahul
    Room? 102
    Check-in? 2025-08-22
    Check-out? 2025-08-24
    Amount? 4200
    -> Booking created: #BKG-1234
    ```
  - Expense:
    ```
    /expense
    Amount? 350
    Category? Housekeeping
    Date? (today, IST)
    [send photo]
    -> Expense captured ✓
    ```
 - Timezone: The bot interprets "today" and other date prompts in IST by default. Admins may set `BOT_TIMEZONE` to another TZ if needed.

## Testing
- Ask a new authorized user to run through flows and report friction.

## Change Log
- 2025-08-21: Initial story draft created.
