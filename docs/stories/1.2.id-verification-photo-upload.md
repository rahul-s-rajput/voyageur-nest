# Story 1.2: ID Verification with Photo Upload

## Status
Draft

## Story Definition

**As a** hotel staff member  
**I want** to capture and verify guest ID documents with photo upload during check-in  
**So that** I can ensure guest identity verification, maintain security compliance, and have proper documentation for legal requirements.

### Story Details
- **Epic**: 1 - Guest Check-in & Data Collection System
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Digital Check-in Form) must be completed

### Business Value
- Enhanced security through proper ID verification
- Compliance with hospitality industry regulations
- Reduced manual paperwork and improved efficiency
- Digital audit trail for guest verification

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: ID Document Photo Capture
- **Given** a guest is completing the check-in process
- **When** they reach the ID verification step
- **Then** they should be able to upload a photo of their government-issued ID
- **And** the system should accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **And** the file size should be limited to 10MB maximum

### AC2: Image Quality Validation
- **Given** a guest uploads an ID photo
- **When** the image is processed
- **Then** the system should validate image quality and readability
- **And** provide feedback if the image is too blurry, dark, or unclear
- **And** allow the guest to retake/reupload if needed

### AC3: Secure Storage and Encryption
- **Given** an ID photo is successfully uploaded
- **When** the image is stored
- **Then** it should be encrypted and stored securely in Supabase Storage
- **And** access should be restricted to authorized personnel only
- **And** the image should be automatically deleted after 30 days for privacy compliance

### AC4: ID Information Extraction (Optional Enhancement)
- **Given** an ID photo is uploaded
- **When** the image is processed
- **Then** the system may attempt to extract basic information (name, ID number)
- **And** pre-populate relevant fields in the check-in form
- **And** allow manual correction of extracted data

### AC5: Mobile-Responsive Photo Capture
- **Given** a guest is using a mobile device
- **When** they need to upload an ID photo
- **Then** they should be able to use the device camera to capture the photo directly
- **And** the interface should be optimized for mobile photo capture
- **And** provide guidance for proper ID positioning

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] 7.5 Add bulk verification capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Technical Considerations
- **File Storage**: Use Supabase Storage with bucket policies for security
- **Image Compression**: Implement client-side compression to reduce upload time
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure camera access works across different mobile browsers
- **Performance**: Lazy load images and implement progressive upload
- **Accessibility**: Ensure screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation

### Security Requirements
- All uploaded images must be encrypted at rest
- Implement secure signed URLs for image access
- Regular security audits of storage policies
- Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

### Integration Points
- Extends the existing check-in form from Story 1.1
- Integrates with Supabase Storage and Database
- May integrate with future AI services for document verification

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues during upload
- File size and format validation errors
- Storage quota limitations
- Camera access permissions on mobile devices

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Image upload component functionality
- [ ] File validation logic
- [ ] Image compression algorithms
- [ ] Database schema updates
- [ ] Storage policy enforcement

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end check-in flow with ID upload
- [ ] Supabase Storage integration
- [ ] Mobile camera functionality
- [ ] File deletion automation
- [ ] Security policy validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Upload various ID document types and formats
- [ ] Test mobile camera capture on different devices
- [ ] Verify file size and format restrictions
- [ ] Test upload progress and error handling
- [ ] Validate automatic file deletion after 30 days

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large file upload performance
- [ ] Multiple concurrent uploads
- [ ] Mobile network conditions
