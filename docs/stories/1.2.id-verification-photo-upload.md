# Story 1.2: ID Verification with Photo Upload

## Status
Done

## Story Definition

**As a** hotel staff member  
**I want** to capture and verify guest ID documents with photo upload during check-in  
**So that** I can ensure guest identity verification, maintain security compliance, and have proper documentation for legal requirements.

### Story Details
- **Epic**: 1 - Guest Check-in & Data Collection System
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Digital Check-in Form) must be completed

### Business Value
- Enhanced security through proper ID verification
- Compliance with hospitality industry regulations
- Reduced manual paperwork and improved efficiency
- Digital audit trail for guest verification

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: ID Document Photo Capture
- **Given** a guest is completing the check-in process
- **When** they reach the ID verification step
- **Then** they should be able to upload a photo of their government-issued ID
- **And** the system should accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **And** the file size should be limited to 10MB maximum

### AC2: Image Quality Validation
- **Given** a guest uploads an ID photo
- **When** the image is processed
- **Then** the system should validate image quality and readability
- **And** provide feedback if the image is too blurry, dark, or unclear
- **And** allow the guest to retake/reupload if needed

### AC3: Secure Storage and Encryption
- **Given** an ID photo is successfully uploaded
- **When** the image is stored
- **Then** it should be encrypted and stored securely in Supabase Storage
- **And** access should be restricted to authorized personnel only
- **And** the image should be automatically deleted after 30 days for privacy compliance

### AC4: ID Information Extraction (Optional Enhancement)
- **Given** an ID photo is uploaded
- **When** the image is processed
- **Then** the system may attempt to extract basic information (name, ID number)
- **And** pre-populate relevant fields in the check-in form
- **And** allow manual correction of extracted data

### AC5: Mobile-Responsive Photo Capture
- **Given** a guest is using a mobile device
- **When** they need to upload an ID photo
- **Then** they should be able to use the device camera to capture the photo directly
- **And** the interface should be optimized for mobile photo capture
- **And** provide guidance for proper ID positioning
