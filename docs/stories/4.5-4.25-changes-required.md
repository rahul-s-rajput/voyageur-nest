## üìã **Quick Checklist for Each Story Update**

When updating each story, ensure:

- [ ] Story 4.0 listed as prerequisite

- [ ] Language changed from "modify/enhance" to "implement/build"
- [ ] References to foundation types/contexts from Story 4.0
- [ ] Dev notes mention clean architecture
- [ ] No references to "existing implementation"
- [ ] Service layer references use `/reports/` path

---

## üí° **Benefits of These Changes**

1. **Clear Dependencies** - Story 4.0 provides everything needed
2. **Clean Architecture** - No confusion about legacy code
3. **Faster Development** - No time spent understanding old code
4. **Better Testing** - Test in isolation without side effects
5. **Easier Onboarding** - New developers start fresh

---

## üöÄ **Migration Note**

Add to Story 4.16 (final story):
```markdown
## Migration from Old Reports
- Add redirect from old expense reports tab
- Show deprecation notice for 30 days
- Preserve user preferences where applicable
- Remove old code after successful migration
```

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

The main changes needed are:
1. Add Story 4.0 as prerequisite to all
2. Update all paths to new structure
3. Remove "enhancement/upgrade" language
4. Reference foundation components/services
5. Note clean architecture benefits

These changes ensure stories 4.5-4.25 correctly reflect building a fresh Reports & Analytics section rather than modifying existing code. The foundation story (4.0) provides everything needed for clean implementation.
