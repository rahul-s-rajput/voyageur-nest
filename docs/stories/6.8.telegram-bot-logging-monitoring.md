# Story: Telegram Bot - Logging & Monitoring
Add minimal structured logging and error handling. Optionally log selected actions to a small table `bot_logs` for auditing.

## Prerequisites
- `6.1` completed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All commands log start/end and errors with a correlation id (chat id + timestamp).
- Errors are caught and user gets a friendly message.
- Optional: `bot_logs` table captures key events (command, user id, property id, created_at).

## Tasks
- Logging wrapper
  - Small helper to log with JSON `{ level, msg, chatId, userId, propId, err? }`.
  - Use console for platform logs; optional DB insert.
- Optional migration
  - `migrations/add_bot_logs.sql` defining minimal schema with RLS allowing only service role inserts.
- Error boundaries
  - Wrap handlers with try/catch; reply with generic fallback.

## Dev Notes
- Consider sampling to avoid excessive writes.
- Align with existing `SecureLogger` patterns in app where applicable.

## Testing
- Force an error (e.g., bad date); confirm friendly message and log appears.

## Change Log
- 2025-08-21: Initial story draft created.
