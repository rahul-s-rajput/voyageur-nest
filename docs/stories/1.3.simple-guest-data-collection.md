# Story 1.3: Simple Guest Data Collection

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** property manager  
**I want** to collect basic guest information during check-in  
**So that** I can maintain records and handle group bookings properly  

### Story Details
- **Epic**: 1 - Guest Check-in & Data Collection System
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Digital Check-in Form) and Story 1.2 (ID Verification with Photo Upload) must be completed

### Business Value
- Improved guest record management and historical tracking
- Better handling of group bookings with multiple guests
- Enhanced guest experience through personalized service
- GDPR-compliant data collection with privacy controls

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Basic Contact Details Collection
- **Given** a guest is completing the check-in process
- **When** they fill out the guest information section
- **Then** the system should collect basic contact details and emergency contact
- **And** validate email format and phone number format
- **And** mark required fields clearly

### AC2: Guest Count and Group Tracking
- **Given** a booking has multiple guests
- **When** the primary guest completes check-in
- **Then** the system should track number of guests in current booking vs previous stays
- **And** allow adding additional guest names if known (simple text field)
- **And** update guest profile with group size patterns

### AC3: Guest Profile Linking
- **Given** a guest completes check-in
- **When** their information is processed
- **Then** the system should link check-in data to guest profile across stays
- **And** create new guest profile if first-time visitor
- **And** update existing profile with latest information

### AC4: Guest History Access
- **Given** a staff member views guest information
- **When** they access the guest profile
- **Then** they should see guest history (number of visits, group sizes)
- **And** view total spending and last stay date
- **And** access simple notes field for important information only

### AC5: GDPR-Compliant Data Handling
- **Given** guest data is collected
- **When** it is stored in the system
- **Then** it should include basic privacy controls
- **And** allow guests to consent to marketing communications
- **And** provide data retention consent options
- **And** ensure secure storage with proper access controls

---

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Requiring Attention**

#### **1. MISSING TEST COVERAGE (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Impact**: Production risk, maintenance difficulty, regression potential

**Issues Found:**
- ❌ **No unit tests** for <mcsymbol name="GuestProfileService" filename="guestProfileService.ts" path="src/services/guestProfileService.ts" startline="8" type="class"></mcsymbol>
- ❌ **No component tests** for guest profile UI components
- ❌ **No integration tests** for guest profile workflows
- ❌ **Missing test coverage** for GDPR compliance features

**Required Actions:**
```typescript
// Required test files to create:
src/tests/unit/services/guestProfileService.test.ts
src/tests/unit/components/GuestProfileView.test.tsx
src/tests/unit/components/GuestProfileForm.test.tsx
src/tests/unit/components/GuestProfileList.test.tsx
src/tests/integration/guest-profile-workflow.test.ts
```

#### **2. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Input Validation**: Missing comprehensive validation for guest data
- ⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on guest profile creation
- ⚠️ **Data Sanitization**: Potential XSS risks in guest notes/comments

**Recommendations:**
- Implement input validation using Zod or similar library
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Sanitize user inputs before database storage

#### **3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Search Performance**: No debouncing on guest search
- ⚠️ **Data Loading**: Missing loading states in some components
- ⚠️ **Caching**: No caching strategy for frequently accessed guest data

---

### 🔧 **Refactoring Recommendations**

#### **1. Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// Current: Basic error handling
// Recommended: Structured error handling with user-friendly messages
try {
  const guest = await GuestProfileService.createGuestProfile(data);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'DUPLICATE_EMAIL') {
    throw new UserFriendlyError('A guest with this email already exists');
  }
  // Handle other specific error types
}
```

#### **2. Search Optimization**
```typescript
// Add debouncing to guest search
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce(async (term: string) => {
    const results = await GuestProfileService.searchGuestProfiles({ search: term });
    setSearchResults(results);
  }, 300),
  []
);
```

#### **3. Data Validation Layer**
```typescript
// Implement Zod schemas for guest data validation
const GuestProfileSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(1).max(50),
  lastName: z.string().min(1).max(50),
  email: z.string().email(),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^\+?[\d\s-()]+$/),
  // ... other validations
});
```

### 📋 **Testing Strategy Required**

#### **Unit Tests (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Service Layer**: Test all CRUD operations, search functionality, error scenarios
- **Components**: Test rendering, user interactions, state management
- **Utilities**: Test data validation, formatting functions

#### **Integration Tests (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Guest Profile Workflow**: End-to-end guest creation and linking
- **Check-in Integration**: Test guest profile integration with check-in process
- **GDPR Compliance**: Test privacy settings and data export/deletion

#### **E2E Tests (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Guest Search**: Test search functionality across different scenarios
- **Profile Management**: Test complete guest profile lifecycle

---

### 🚀 **Deployment Readiness**

#### **Ready for Production:**
- ✅ Core functionality implemented
- ✅ Database schema properly designed
- ✅ UI components functional
- ✅ Basic security measures in place

#### **Blockers for Production:**
- ❌ **Test coverage below 80%** (current: ~0%)
- ❌ **Missing input validation**
- ❌ **No performance testing**
