# Story 4.20: Reports & Analytics - Mobile UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a mobile user,
I want native-like interactions,
So that the app feels smooth and responsive.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Floating Action Button (FAB) for quick actions (Export, Filter, Share)
2. Pull-to-refresh gesture on report pages with progress indicator
3. Bottom sheet filters (slide-up) with drag handle and backdrop
4. Haptic feedback on key actions (where supported)
5. Smooth 60fps animations for transitions and gestures

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] `FabActions` with speed-dial menu
- [ ] `PullToRefresh` wrapper with threshold and a11y
- [ ] `BottomSheetFilters` (touch + keyboard accessible)
- [ ] Haptics: `navigator.vibrate` fallback
- [ ] Performance tuning: GPU-accelerated transforms, passive listeners, reduced reflow

## Dev Notes
- References: improvement plan (mobile UX)
- Suggested locations:
  - `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/mobile/FabActions.tsx`
  - `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/mobile/PullToRefresh.tsx`
  - `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/mobile/BottomSheetFilters.tsx`
- Libraries: Swiper, Hammer.js, Radix/Headless UI for a11y primitives
- Targets: First Input Delay <100ms; steady 60fps
- Foundation: Story 4.0 provides base architecture
- Location: New ReportsAnalytics section (not ExpenseManagement)
- No legacy code dependencies

## Testing
- [ ] FAB: reachable, keyboard-accessible, no accidental taps
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh: smooth, cancelable, no jank
- [ ] Bottom sheet: drag/responsive; screen reader labels
- [ ] Low-end Android device performance under 3G
- [ ] Orientation changes handled (portrait/landscape)

## Success Metrics
- Touch interaction success: >95% first attempt
- UI jank: <1% frames over 16ms during gestures

## Integration Points
- Filters: bottom sheet integrates with `AdvancedFilterPanel`
- Real-time: pull-to-refresh triggers immediate fetch

## Prerequisites
- Story 4.0 (Reports & Analytics Foundation) must be completed
