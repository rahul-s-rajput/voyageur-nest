# Story 4.15: Reports & Analytics - Performance Optimization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a user,
I want fast load, progressive content, and small bundle sizes,
So that the reports feel responsive even with large datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Data Caching
   - <2s initial load
   - Instant cached views
   - Background updates
2. Progressive Loading
   - Skeleton screens
   - Lazy load charts
   - Virtual scrolling where applicable
3. Code Splitting
   - <200KB initial bundle
   - Dynamic imports
   - Route-based splitting

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement client caching and background revalidation
  - [ ] IndexedDB for large datasets
  - [ ] Service worker cache strategies
  - [ ] Stale-while-revalidate pattern
  - [ ] Cache versioning and cleanup
  - [ ] Offline queue for actions
- [ ] Add skeletons, lazy chart loading, virtualization
  - [ ] Component-specific skeletons
  - [ ] Progressive chart rendering
  - [ ] Virtual scrolling for tables
  - [ ] Intersection Observer for lazy load
  - [ ] Image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Configure code splitting and measure bundle size
  - [ ] Route-based splitting
  - [ ] Component lazy loading
  - [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
  - [ ] Bundle analysis and optimization
  - [ ] Tree shaking configuration
- [ ] Real-time optimization
  - [ ] WebSocket connection pooling
  - [ ] Debounced updates
  - [ ] Differential updates only
  - [ ] Connection retry with backoff
- [ ] PWA enhancements
  - [ ] App shell architecture
  - [ ] Background sync
  - [ ] Push notifications
  - [ ] Offline indicators

## Dev Notes
- Reference: `docs/implementation-plans/expense-reports-ui-improvement-plan.md` (Phase 5 - Task 5.1)
- Use React.memo and lazy as per guide
- Architecture:
  - Service Worker with Workbox
  - IndexedDB with Dexie.js
  - React.lazy for code splitting
  - React-window for virtualization
- Suggested locations:
  - Components: `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/perf/Skeletons.tsx`, `src/components/ReportsAnalytics/perf/VirtualizedTable.tsx`
  - Hooks: `src/hooks/usePerformanceMetrics.ts`, `src/hooks/useLazyCharts.ts`
  - Lib: `src/lib/perf/bundleAnalyzer.ts`, `src/lib/perf/network.ts`
  - SW: `src/serviceWorker.ts`
  - Storage: `src/lib/indexeddb.ts`
- Foundation: Story 4.0 provides base architecture
- Location: New ReportsAnalytics section (not ExpenseManagement)
- No legacy code dependencies
- Performance Budget:
  - FCP: <1.5s on 3G
  - TTI: <3s on 3G
  - Bundle: <200KB initial
  - Runtime: 60fps scrolling
- Optimization Techniques:
  - Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)
  - Virtual DOM optimization
  - Web Workers for heavy computation
  - RequestIdleCallback for non-critical
- Network Optimization:
  - HTTP/2 push
  - Brotli compression
  - CDN for static assets
  - API response caching
- Guest House Context:
  - Slow mountain internet (optimize for 2G/3G)
  - Offline functionality crucial
  - Battery optimization for mobile
  - Quick property switching

## Testing
- [ ] Lighthouse performance budgets met (>90 score)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling and chart loading (60fps)
- [ ] Bundle size and TTI targets achieved
- [ ] 2G/3G network performance
- [ ] Offline mode functionality
- [ ] Memory leaks detection
- [ ] CPU usage monitoring
- [ ] Battery drain testing
- [ ] Large dataset handling (10,000+ rows)
- [ ] Concurrent user load testing
- [ ] Cache invalidation correctness
- [ ] Service worker update flow

## Success Metrics
- Page load: <2s on 3G
- Interaction: <100ms response
- Offline usage: 100% core features work
- Memory: <100MB for typical session
- Battery: <5% drain per hour

## Integration Points
- Real-time: Optimized WebSocket handling
- Charts: Lazy loading and virtualization
- Exports: Background processing
- Multi-property: Cached property data
- PWA: Full offline capability

## Prerequisites
- Story 4.0 (Reports & Analytics Foundation) must be completed

## Dependencies
- 4.25: React Query + TanStack Table — normalized caching, background revalidation, and table virtualization
- 4.19: PWA & Offline Support — app shell, service worker strategies, background sync
- 4.17: Real-time Updates & Auto-refresh — differential updates, debouncing, connection pooling
- 4.20: Mobile UI Enhancements — mobile perf budgets, gesture optimization, and lazy behaviors
- 4.21: Chart Export & Sharing — off-thread/scheduled export processing where applicable
- 4.24: Mobile Push Notifications — service worker coordination and battery-conscious delivery
- 4.18: Dark Mode & Print Support — avoids repaint costs with tokenized theming
- 4.22/4.23: Weather & Local Events — optional context layers; ensure overlays are virtualized/lazy
