# Story: Security, RLS, and Testing Plan
Harden property-scoped access and provide a full testing strategy across DB, services, UI, and bot.

## Prerequisites
- Schema and services ready (`7.1`, `7.2`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- RLS policies in place with explicit select/insert/update/delete policies.
- Basic test data seeding guide exists.
- Documented test cases for voids, refunds, and discount math.

## Tasks
- Document RLS policies modeled on `menu_items`/`expenses`.
- Add a test checklist for DB (RLS), services, UI, bot.
- Provide sample SQL for seed data.

## Dev Notes
- Consider a read-only role for reporting if needed.

## Testing
- DB: attempt cross-property access; ensure denied.
- Services/UI/bot: run through main flows; verify aggregates vs view.

## Change Log
- 2025-08-22: Story drafted.
