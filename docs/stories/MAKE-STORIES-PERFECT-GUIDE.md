# Story 4.25: Advanced Data Patterns & Optimization

## Prerequisites
- Story 4.0 (Reports & Analytics Foundation) completed
- React Query and TanStack Table already configured

## Architecture Context
- Location: Enhancement of existing /ReportsAnalytics/ infrastructure
- Optimizes foundation from Story 4.0
- Focus on advanced patterns and scale

## Story
As a developer,
I want to implement advanced data patterns and performance optimizations,
So that the Reports & Analytics section handles large-scale data efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Advanced React Query Patterns
- [ ] Infinite queries for paginated expense lists
- [ ] Parallel queries for dashboard widgets
- [ ] Dependent queries for drill-down scenarios
- [ ] Optimistic updates for all mutations
- [ ] Selective cache invalidation
- [ ] Query result transformation and normalization

### 2. TanStack Table Optimizations  
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for 10,000+ rows
- [ ] Column virtualization for 50+ columns
- [ ] Row grouping with multi-level aggregation
- [ ] Excel-like cell editing with validation
- [ ] Custom cell renderers with memoization
- [ ] Export visible/filtered data to CSV/Excel

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement selective real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Add query result compression for large datasets
- [ ] Configure intelligent prefetching strategies
- [ ] Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns
- [ ] Add request deduplication
- [ ] Bundle similar API calls

### 4. Data Consistency & Sync
- [ ] Cross-tab synchronization via BroadcastChannel
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] Offline queue with retry logic
- [ ] Version control for custom dashboards
- [ ] Optimistic UI with rollback on failure

### 5. Caching Strategies
- [ ] Time-based cache invalidation
- [ ] Manual cache management UI for admins
- [ ] Differential updates for real-time data
- [ ] Cache warming for common queries
- [ ] Storage quota management

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement advanced query patterns
- [ ] Optimize table rendering performance
- [ ] Add cache management utilities
- [ ] Build sync mechanisms
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Document patterns for team

## Technical Implementation
- Enhance QueryClient configuration from Story 4.0
- Extend TanStack Table setup with plugins
- Add IndexedDB for large dataset caching
- Implement WebWorker for heavy computations

## Dev Notes
- This story ENHANCES the setup from Story 4.0
- Focus on optimization, not initial setup
- Document patterns for future features
- Consider bundle size impact

## Testing
- [ ] Load test with 100,000 expense records
- [ ] Verify 60fps scrolling with large tables
- [ ] Test offline/online transitions
- [ ] Validate cross-tab synchronization
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Bundle size remains under budget

## Success Metrics
- Table renders 10,000 rows at 60fps
- Query cache hit rate >80%
- Bundle size increase <20KB
- Memory usage stable over time
- Zero data inconsistencies

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-01-25 | 2.0 | Complete rewrite for optimization focus | Team |

## 🟢 PRIORITY 4: Update Paths in Stories 4.5-4.24

### FIND and REPLACE in each story:

```
FIND: src/components/PropertyManagement/ExpenseManagement/
REPLACE: src/components/ReportsAnalytics/

FIND: src/components/Reports/
REPLACE: src/components/ReportsAnalytics/

FIND: src/services/expenseService
REPLACE: src/services/reports/ReportsService

FIND: src/hooks/useExpense
REPLACE: src/hooks/reports/useReports

FIND: ExpenseManagement context
REPLACE: ReportsAnalytics context
```

---

## 🟢 PRIORITY 5: Language Updates

### FIND and REPLACE in stories 4.5-4.16:

```
FIND: "enhance existing"
REPLACE: "implement"

FIND: "modify current"
