# Story 4.11: Expense Reports - Predictive Features

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a finance lead,
I want forecasting, anomaly detection, and budget recommendations,
So that I can anticipate spend and quickly address issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Expense Forecasting
   - 30/60/90 day forecasts
   - Confidence intervals
   - Seasonality detection
2. Anomaly Detection
   - Real-time alerts
   - Severity levels
   - Explanation tooltips
3. Budget Recommendations
   - Category-wise suggestions
   - Historical analysis basis
   - Apply with one click

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add forecast service (stub initially) with intervals and seasonality flags
  - [ ] Time series analysis with ARIMA/Prophet models
  - [ ] Seasonal decomposition for Manali patterns
  - [ ] Weather correlation integration
  - [ ] Confidence interval visualization
- [ ] Implement anomaly detector with thresholds and explanations
  - [ ] Statistical outlier detection (Z-score, IQR)
  - [ ] Pattern-based anomaly detection
  - [ ] Contextual alerts (e.g., high heating in summer)
  - [ ] Severity scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Auto-learning from user feedback
- [ ] Generate recommendations and provide apply action
  - [ ] ML-based budget optimization
  - [ ] Seasonal adjustment suggestions
  - [ ] Vendor consolidation opportunities
  - [ ] Cost-saving action items
  - [ ] One-click implementation
- [ ] Integrate with AI services
  - [ ] Gemini Flash for natural language insights
  - [ ] Custom ML models for property-specific patterns
  - [ ] Real-time model updates

## Dev Notes
- Reference: `docs/implementation-plans/expense-reports-ui-improvement-plan.md` (Phase 3 - Task 3.1)
- Surface predictions in `ResponsiveChartContainer` with legends
- Feature-flag until validated
- Architecture:
  - `PredictionService` with pluggable models
  - `AnomalyEngine` for detection logic
  - `RecommendationEngine` for insights
- ML/AI Integration:
  - Gemini Flash API for insights
  - TensorFlow.js for client-side predictions
  - Historical data minimum: 6 months
- Performance:
  - Prediction generation: <1s
  - Anomaly detection: <200ms
  - Real-time scoring
- Guest House Context:
  - Seasonal patterns (Peak: May-Jun, Oct-Nov)
  - Weather impact on utilities
  - Tourist season correlation
  - Festival period spikes
  - Multi-property pattern comparison

## Testing
- [ ] Forecasts render with intervals; seasonality indicators present
- [ ] Anomalies flagged with severity and tooltips
- [ ] Apply recommendations updates data model and UI
- [ ] Prediction accuracy >80% for 30-day forecast
- [ ] Anomaly detection catches known issues
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and relevant
- [ ] Performance with large datasets
- [ ] Graceful degradation without historical data
- [ ] Mobile rendering of predictions
- [ ] Export includes forecast data
- [ ] Real-time prediction updates
- [ ] Dark mode visualization

## Success Metrics
- Forecast accuracy: >80% for 30-day predictions
- Anomaly detection: 95% true positive rate
- Recommendation adoption: >40% implemented
- Cost savings: 10-15% reduction identified
- User trust: >70% confidence in predictions

## Integration Points
- Budget planning: Forecasts inform budgets
- Alerts: Anomalies trigger notifications
- Expense approval: Flag anomalous expenses
- Vendor management: Identify optimization opportunities
- Weather API: Correlate with weather patterns

## Dependencies
- 4.17: Real-time Updates & Auto-refresh — real-time model scoring and live anomaly streams
- 4.18: Dark Mode & Print Support — consistent theming and print styles for forecast visuals
- 4.19: PWA & Offline Support — offline access to last predictions and queued feedback
- 4.20: Mobile UI Enhancements — mobile gestures and haptics for anomaly interactions
- 4.21: Chart Export & Sharing — include forecasts, intervals, and anomalies in exports/shares
- 4.24: Mobile Push Notifications — anomaly/budget alert delivery with quiet hours
- 4.25: React Query + TanStack Table — caching of prediction results and invalidation on updates
- 4.22/4.23: Weather & Local Events — features for correlation inputs and explanations
