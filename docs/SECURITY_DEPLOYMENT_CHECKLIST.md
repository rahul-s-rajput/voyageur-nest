## üö® **DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:**

#### 1. **Apply Database Migration** - **MANDATORY**
```bash
# Apply the critical security fix migration
psql -h [SUPABASE_HOST] -U [USER] -d [DATABASE] -f critical_security_fix_migration.sql
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] RLS policies are active on `checkin_data` table
- [ ] Storage policies are secure for `id-documents` bucket
- [ ] Audit logging table is created and accessible
- [ ] Rate limiting table is created and accessible

#### 2. **Run Security Audit** - **MANDATORY**
```bash
# Run the security audit script
npm run security-audit
# or
ts-node scripts/security-audit.ts
```

**Requirements:**
- [ ] **0 CRITICAL issues**
- [ ] **0 HIGH severity issues**
- [ ] All database tests pass
- [ ] All file validation tests pass
- [ ] All rate limiting tests pass

#### 3. **Environment Configuration** - **MANDATORY**
- [ ] Supabase RLS is enabled globally
- [ ] Storage bucket policies are applied
- [ ] Database functions are deployed
- [ ] Rate limiting tables are populated

#### 4. **Code Deployment** - **MANDATORY**
- [ ] Enhanced file validator is deployed
- [ ] Server-side rate limiter is deployed
- [ ] Updated CheckInForm component is deployed
- [ ] All security utilities are available

## üîç **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **Immediate Checks (Within 1 hour):**
1. [ ] **Database Access Test**
   - Verify anonymous users cannot access other guests' data
   - Confirm staff can access all data with proper authentication

2. [ ] **File Upload Test**
   - Upload malicious file (should be rejected)
   - Upload oversized file (should be rejected)
   - Upload valid file (should succeed)

3. [ ] **Rate Limiting Test**
   - Submit form multiple times rapidly (should be blocked)
   - Wait for cooldown period (should be allowed again)

4. [ ] **Audit Logging Test**
   - Verify check-in actions are logged
   - Confirm sensitive data is sanitized in logs

### **24-Hour Monitoring:**
- [ ] Monitor error logs for security violations
- [ ] Check rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Verify no unauthorized data access
- [ ] Confirm audit logs are being generated

---

## üö´ **ROLLBACK PLAN**

### **If Critical Issues Are Found:**

#### 1. **Immediate Actions:**
- [ ] Disable check-in form temporarily
- [ ] Block file uploads
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode

#### 2. **Database Rollback:**
```sql
-- Emergency rollback (if needed)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "checkin_data_booking_access" ON public.checkin_data;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "checkin_data_staff_access" ON public.checkin_data;
-- Apply temporary restrictive policy
CREATE POLICY "emergency_block_all" ON public.checkin_data FOR ALL USING (false);
```

#### 3. **Code Rollback:**
- [ ] Revert to previous stable version
- [ ] Restore client-side rate limiting temporarily
- [ ] Disable file uploads until fixed
