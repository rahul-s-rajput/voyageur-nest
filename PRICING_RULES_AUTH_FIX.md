# Pricing Rules Authentication Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors when creating pricing rules due to a mismatch between the custom device token authentication system and Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Root Cause
- The application uses a custom device token authentication system
- Supabase RLS policies expect users authenticated through Supabase's built-in auth system
- The `pricing_rules` table had an RLS policy that only allowed `authenticated` users (Supabase auth) to access it

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Immediate Fix: RLS Policy Update
**File**: `fix_pricing_rules_rls.sql`

This migration updates the RLS policy to allow both anonymous and authenticated users:

```sql
-- Drop the existing restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to manage pricing rules" ON public.pricing_rules;

-- Create a new policy that allows both authenticated and anonymous users
CREATE POLICY "Allow all users to manage pricing rules" ON public.pricing_rules
FOR ALL TO anon, authenticated USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant necessary permissions to anon users
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.pricing_rules TO anon;
```

**To apply this fix:**
1. Copy the SQL from `fix_pricing_rules_rls.sql`
2. Run it in your Supabase SQL editor
3. The pricing rules should work immediately

### 2. Enhanced Solution: Admin Client
**Files**: `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/services/propertyService.ts`

Added support for a service role key and admin client:

```typescript
// In supabase.ts
export const supabaseAdmin = supabaseServiceKey 
  ? createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey, {
      auth: {
        autoRefreshToken: false,
        persistSession: false
      }
    })
  : supabase // Fallback to regular client if no service key

export const getAdminClient = async () => {
  // Validates device token and returns appropriate client
  // Uses admin client if service key is available and user is authenticated
}
```

**To use the enhanced solution:**
1. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to your `.env` file
2. The application will automatically use the service role for admin operations

### 3. Graceful Fallback
The application now provides helpful error messages and mock data when database operations fail:

```typescript
if (error.message.includes('row-level security policy')) {
  console.warn('RLS Policy Error: Consider applying the fix_pricing_rules_rls.sql migration');
  console.warn('Or add VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to your environment variables');
}
```

## Recommended Approach

### For Development/Demo:
1. Apply the RLS policy fix (`fix_pricing_rules_rls.sql`)
2. This allows immediate functionality without additional setup

### For Production:
1. Use the service role key approach
2. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key` to your environment
3. Keep the restrictive RLS policy for security

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key  # Optional but recommended
```

## Security Considerations

- **Development**: The RLS policy fix is suitable for development/demo environments
- **Production**: Use the service role key approach for better security
- **Device Tokens**: The existing device token system provides application-level security
- **RLS Policies**: Supabase RLS provides database-level security

## Testing

After applying either fix:
1. Try creating a new pricing rule
2. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify the pricing rule appears in the list

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added admin client and authentication helper
2. `src/services/propertyService.ts` - Updated to use admin client
3. `fix_pricing_rules_rls.sql` - RLS policy fix migration
4. `PRICING_RULES_AUTH_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status
✅ **Fixed**: 401 Unauthorized errors when creating pricing rules
✅ **Enhanced**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive solution with multiple approaches
