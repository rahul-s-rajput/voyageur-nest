# Voyageur Nest - Booking Management System

A secure hotel booking management system with device-based authentication and guest check-in functionality.

## Security Features

### Device-Based Authentication
- **Persistent Login**: Once authenticated on a device, you won't need to log in again for 90 days
- **Mobile PWA Support**: Can be saved to mobile home screen for app-like experience
- **Device Tokens**: Secure UUID-based authentication system

### Route Separation
- **Guest Routes**: `/checkin/:bookingId` - Public check-in forms for guests
- **Admin Routes**: `/admin` - Protected booking management system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the following SQL migrations in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Device Tokens Table** (Run `device_tokens_migration.sql`):
```sql
-- This creates the device_tokens table and generates an initial admin token
-- Copy the generated token from the query result for first-time login
```

2. **Check-in Data Table** (Run `checkin_data_migration_fixed.sql`):
```sql
-- This creates the check-in data table with snake_case columns only
-- Drop existing checkin_data table first if it exists
```

### 2. First-Time Admin Access

1. Run the `device_tokens_migration.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the generated device token from the query result
3. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
4. Enter the device token when prompted
5. Your device will be remembered for 90 days

### 3. Mobile PWA Setup

#### For iOS (Safari):
1. Open the website in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add" to confirm

#### For Android (Chrome):
1. Open the website in Chrome
2. Tap the three-dot menu
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add" to confirm

#### For Android (Other browsers):
1. Look for "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen" option
2. Follow the browser-specific prompts

## Usage

### Admin Access
- Navigate to `/admin` or the root URL
- Enter your device token (one-time setup per device)
- Access full booking management system
- Logout removes device authentication

### Guest Check-in
- Guests receive links like `/checkin/BOOKING_ID`
- No authentication required
- After successful check-in, guests see completion message
- No access to admin functions

### Device Token Management
- **Built-in Token Management**: Use the admin interface to generate, view, and manage tokens
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable from 30 days to 1 year (default: 90 days)
- **Multiple Devices**: Generate separate tokens for each device/user
- **Security Controls**: Activate, deactivate, or delete tokens as needed
- **Emergency Access**: Manual token generation via SQL if locked out

## Security Benefits

1. **No Password Storage**: Uses device tokens instead of traditional passwords
2. **Device Binding**: Each token is tied to specific device information
3. **Automatic Expiry**: Tokens expire after 90 days
4. **Guest Isolation**: Guests cannot access admin functions
5. **Persistent Mobile Auth**: Perfect for mobile devices saved to home screen

## Technical Details

- Device fingerprinting for additional security
- Automatic token validation and refresh
- localStorage for client-side persistence

### PWA Features
- Manifest file for "Add to Home Screen"
- Standalone display mode
- Custom app icons
- Mobile-optimized experience

### Database Schema
- `device_tokens`: Authentication tokens and device info
- `checkin_data`: Guest check-in information (snake_case columns)
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Troubleshooting

### Token Management Issues

#### "Invalid or expired device token"
- **Solution 1**: Use Token Management interface to generate new token
- **Solution 2**: Check token status in admin panel â†’ Device Tokens tab
- **Solution 3**: Manual SQL token generation (see TOKEN_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md)

#### Need token for new device
1. Log in with existing device that has valid token
2. Go to admin panel â†’ Device Tokens tab
3. Generate new token with descriptive name
4. Copy token and use on new device

#### All tokens expired/lost
- Use emergency SQL method in TOKEN_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
- Generate new token via Supabase SQL Editor
- Always keep backup tokens active

### Check-in form errors
- Ensure `checkin_data_migration_fixed.sql` was run
- Verify snake_case column names in database
- Check Supabase connection and permissions

### PWA not installing
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for PWA)
- Check manifest.json is accessible
- Verify browser PWA support

### Token Management Best Practices
- **Generate tokens before expiry**: Don't wait until tokens expire
- **Use descriptive names**: "John's iPhone", "Reception iPad"
- **Regular cleanup**: Delete unused tokens monthly
- **Keep backup tokens**: Always have 2+ active tokens
