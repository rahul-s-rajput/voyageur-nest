# UI module scaffold

This folder will contain presentation helpers for inline keyboards, message text builders, and view composition for the Telegram bot.

- Keep these modules pure (no direct DB calls).
- Consume data from services/ and state/ modules.
- Export small builders: keyboards, message texts, and menus.
