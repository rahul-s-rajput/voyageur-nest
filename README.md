## Database Schema

The `bookings` table includes:
- Guest information (name, contact details)
- Room and dates (room number, check-in/out dates)
- Booking details (number of guests, special requests)
- Financial info (total amount, payment status)
- Status tracking (confirmed, pending, cancelled, etc.)
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your Supabase credentials in `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

3. Run the database migrations:
   ```sql
   -- Run the SQL in database.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Current State

The application now loads with a booking management dashboard instead of the invoice generator. You can:
- View booking statistics
- Switch between calendar and list views (placeholders)
- Search through bookings
- Create invoices from existing bookings
- Access the original invoice functionality

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing UI components (calendar, detailed list, forms)
2. Add booking CRUD operations to the frontend
3. Implement payment tracking
4. Add booking status management
5. Create booking reports and analytics

The foundation is solid with full backend support and type safety throughout the application.
