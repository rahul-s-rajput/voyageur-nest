# Expense Approval Issues - Final Fix

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Triple Notifications
- **Disabled NotificationCenter subscription** - Only NotificationContainer handles notifications now
- **Improved singleton pattern** - Uses Set to track instances and only creates one subscription
- **Handles React StrictMode** - Properly manages multiple component instances

### 2. Fixed Status Update Issue
- **Enhanced error handling** - Added try-catch blocks around service calls
- **Improved state update** - Using array index replacement instead of map
- **Added extensive logging** - To track the exact flow of data

## Test Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Browser State
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Clear Storage
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Step 2: Test Approval Flow
1. Navigate to Properties → Expense Management
2. Find a "pending" expense
3. Open Chrome DevTools Console (F12 → Console tab)
4. Click the "Approve" button
5. Add optional notes in the dialog
6. Click "Approve" in the confirmation dialog

### Expected Console Logs
You should see these logs in order:
```
[ExpenseManagement] Approve button clicked for expense: <id>
[ExpenseManagement] ConfirmDialog onConfirm called
[ExpenseManagement] confirmActionRef.current: <function>
[ExpenseManagement] Calling confirm action function
[ExpenseManagement] Confirm action called for expense: <id>
[ExpenseManagement] Starting approval process for: <id> approved
[ExpenseManagement] Approving expense: <id> approved with notes: 
[ExpenseService] Setting approval for expense: <id> to status: approved
[ExpenseService] Raw response from database: {...}
[ExpenseService] Transformed expense: {...}
[ExpenseManagement] Received updated expense: {...}
[ExpenseManagement] About to update state with expense: {...}
[ExpenseManagement] Current expenses before update: <number>
[ExpenseManagement] Looking for expense with id: <id>
[ExpenseManagement] Found expense at index: <number>
[ExpenseManagement] Old expense: {...approvalStatus: "pending"...}
[ExpenseManagement] New expense: {...approvalStatus: "approved"...}
[ExpenseManagement] Updated expense at index: <number> {...}
[NotificationContainer] Creating global notification subscription (ONLY ONCE)
[NotificationContainer] Showing toast notification for: <id> Expense approved (ONLY ONCE)
[ExpenseManagement] Approval process completed successfully
[ExpenseManagement] Confirm action function completed
[ExpenseManagement] Verification after update: {...approvalStatus: "approved"...}
```

### What to Verify

1. **Single Notification**
   - You should see ONLY ONE toast notification appear
   - Console should show only ONE "[NotificationContainer] Showing toast notification"

2. **Status Update**
   - The expense status should immediately change from "pending" to "approved"
   - The yellow "pending" badge should change to green "approved"
   - Approve/Reject buttons should disappear
   - The change should persist after page refresh

### If Issues Still Persist

1. **Check for Errors**
   - Look for any red error messages in the console
   - Check if any of the expected logs are missing
   - Note which log was the last one before any error

2. **Check React StrictMode**
   - React StrictMode (which is enabled) causes components to render twice in development
   - This is normal and shouldn't affect functionality
   - The singleton pattern should handle this

3. **Check State**
   - In the logs, verify that:
     - Old expense shows `approvalStatus: "pending"`
     - New expense shows `approvalStatus: "approved"`
     - The index is found (not -1)

4. **Force Refresh**
   - After approval, manually refresh the page
   - The expense should still show as "approved"

## Known Issues

1. **React StrictMode** - Causes double rendering in development (this is intentional by React)
2. **Multiple transformExpenseFromDB logs** - Normal when loading expenses list

## Debug Mode

If you need more detailed logging, uncomment the debug logs in:
- `src/services/expenseService.ts` (line 397-401)

## Summary

The fixes address:
1. **Notification deduplication** by using a proper singleton pattern
2. **State update issues** by using array index replacement
3. **Error handling** with proper try-catch blocks
4. **React StrictMode** compatibility

The expense should now:
- Show only ONE notification
- Update status immediately
- Persist the change after refresh
